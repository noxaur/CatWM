# Fake backend

`WindowBackend` (`Tiling/Access/WindowBackend.swift`) is the boundary between the tiling engine and macOS. `AXBackend.shared` sends each call to AX, the window server and `NSWorkspace`. `FakeBackend` (`Tests/Fakes/FakeBackend.swift`) runs the real engine on in-memory windows and screens, so tests need no permissions, GUI or real apps. Change the fake, run the engine and examine the result. Don't copy engine logic into a test.

Fake pids are negative, so no AX call can reach a real app. `fake.makeManager()` uses the default config text with animation, gaps, warps and Desktops off. `Config.load()` would read and can write the user's config.

Tests wait on the engine, never on time. `Tools/check-style.sh` rejects sleeps and fixed run-loop waits. `settle` repeats scan, refresh and AX writes until a round writes nothing, and it returns `false` after 8 rounds or 10 s. `wait(_:until:)` re-checks on each `onChange` for timer-driven steps, such as the minimum-size check 0.12 s after a placement.

## Input and Desktops go through the backend

Switching a Desktop posts a real Ctrl+arrow keystroke, and moving a window to one presses and drags it with the real pointer. An engine on a fake once did both to the user's own screen: `CatWMPerf engine-actions` ran `workspace 2` and the keystrokes switched the user's Desktops. `WindowBackend` therefore also owns every read and write of the pointer, the keyboard and the Desktop list: `pointerLocation`, `warpPointer`, `post`, `postMouse`, `serverFrame`, `spaceList` and the two system shortcuts. `FakeBackend` keeps a pointer, a Desktop count and a current Desktop, records each call in `inputs`, plays a step as a Desktop switch and carries a held window with it, so a test checks the recorded switch instead of the screen.

The alternative was an `isFake` check at each call site. It was rejected because the next call site would miss it, which is how the first leak happened. `RealInput` is the second layer for a path that skips the backend. It guards the lowest posting functions (`Hotkeys.post`, `DesktopSwipe.post`, the Desktop bridge, `Spaces.move`, `AXBackend`'s pointer calls). `FakeBackend.init` blocks it for the process, and so does any process that loads XCTest unless a `CATWM_TEST_*` flag is 1. A blocked call does nothing, counts in `RealInput.refusals` and traps in a debug build. The cursor refresh passes `traps: false`: it re-posts the pointer where it already is, and tests that build a manager on `AXBackend.shared` reach it. A backend that leaves the seam out gets defaults that read nothing and trap on a post.

## Limits

These parts aren't behind `WindowBackend`, so a fake test can't drive them:

- Native Desktop machinery (`NativeDesktopController`, `Spaces.move`, the Desktop bridge). Leave it off in a fake test. In a blocked process it posts nothing and does nothing.
- AX observers. `AXObserverCreate` fails for a negative pid, so send a notification with `manager.handle(_:_:)`.
- The focus sink window, which `parkFocus` shows when focus moves to an empty display or workspace.
- Direct window-server reads, such as `CGWindowInfo.onScreen()` in the Overview and the split handles, and direct `Spaces.list`, `Spaces.of` and `Spaces.current` reads.
- `Window.isValid` and the other `Window` reads that go straight to the AX element.
- The Dock click tap (`DockWindowPull`), which posts events itself.
- Template capture and restore.

`twoHundredWindowsRetileInLessThan50Milliseconds` guards the cost of a relayout. It measures only main-thread work, because other suites can hold the main actor during `settle`.
