# CatWM website

Landing page for CatWM: the brand lockup on one flat accent field, a scroll story that plays the real
window manager behaviour (windows opening into their slots, window mode, workspaces, layouts, saved
workspaces, overview, CLI), the install command and an email signup.

`app/catwm/layout.ts` is a port of the Swift layout and neighbour code. `app/catwm/script.ts` holds the
state, the dispatcher reducers and the scripted steps. `app/catwm/Story.tsx` builds one GSAP timeline per
step from them, at the animator's real timing (0.18 s, cubic ease-out). Change the Swift code and the
port together.

- React Router 8 (framework mode, SSR)
- Vite+ (`vp`) for dev, build, format, lint, and type checks
- Void for deployment to Cloudflare Workers. Signups go to Void KV under the `signups:` prefix.
