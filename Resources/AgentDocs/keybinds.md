# Keybinds

A bind is a `catwm.bind(mods, key, run, options?)` call. Put the calls at the top level of the config:

```ts
import { catwm } from "./catwm"

catwm.bind(["alt", "shift"], "tab", ["switcher", "prev"])
catwm.bind([], "h", ["movefocus", "l"], { repeat: true, submap: "window" })   // no mods: only in a mode
catwm.bind(["alt"], "o", "sort")                                               // an action with no arguments
catwm.bind(["alt"], "c", () => catwm.window.focused.float())                   // a function that acts on the focused window
```

- `mods`: any of `"cmd"`, `"alt"`, `"ctrl"`, `"shift"`. Leave it out in a mode. A constant such as `const mod = "alt"` works: `[mod, "shift"]`.
- `key`: a letter, digit, `f1`–`f12`, `space`, `return`, `escape`, `backspace`, arrows (`left right up down`), `capslock`, and so on, plus the scroll and swipe keys below. `catwm.d.ts` lists them all.
- `run`: an action name, or the name and its arguments. The arguments are the ones the `.conf` file used after the dispatcher. [dispatchers.md](dispatchers.md) lists every action.
- `{ repeat: true }` runs the action again while the key is held. `{ submap: "name" }` puts the bind in a mode.
- A function runs when the key is pressed. `catwm.window.focused` has `title`, `app`, `pid` and `frame`, and the methods `float()`, `tile()`, `resize(w, h)`, `move(x, y)`, `center()`, `fullscreen()`, `pin()`, `scratchpad(name)` and `moveTo(workspace)`. CatWM reads the focused window when you press the key, runs the function on the config thread without waiting for it, then runs the steps it recorded in order on that window, even if the focus moved in between. A function that throws, or runs longer than the time limit, does nothing and shows an error like a broken config.
- The macOS app-shortcut caveat: binding `cmd` combos like Q or C replaces the standard app shortcut. Settings → Shortcuts flags those in orange.

## Many keys at once

There's no range syntax. Write ordinary TypeScript:

```ts
import { catwm } from "./catwm"

for (const [index, key] of ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"].entries()) {
  catwm.bind(["alt"], key, ["workspace", String(index + 1)])
}
for (const [index, key] of (["h", "j", "k", "l"] as const).entries()) {
  catwm.bind(["alt", "ctrl"], key, ["movefocus", "ldur"[index]])
}
```

## The old `.conf` syntax

`catwm.conf` used `bind = MODS, key, dispatcher, args` lines with `$vars`, ranges (`1..0`) and lists (`h|j|k|l`). The first launch converts it: variables become constants and each range becomes one bind for each key.

## Window mode (submaps)

```ts
catwm.bind(["cmd"], "capslock", ["submap", "window"])   // enter the mode (Caps Lock itself is left alone)
catwm.bind([], "h", ["movefocus", "l"], { submap: "window" })
catwm.bind(["shift"], "h", ["movewindow", "l"], { submap: "window" })
catwm.bind([], "escape", ["submap", "reset"], { submap: "window" })
```

- While on, "-- WINDOW --" appears at the screen bottom and the menu bar shows WINDOW.
- Keys with no bind in the mode are swallowed. ⌘ and ⌃ shortcuts still reach apps.
- Clicking anywhere leaves the mode, except a right click on a window: it opens that window's context menu and the mode stays on.
- Always give the mode an exit (`["submap", "reset"]`) or the user gets stuck.
- Mode names are free-form; `window` is what the UI's "Window mode" tab edits.

## Scroll and swipes

Keys: `mouse_up`, `mouse_down`, `mouse_left`, `mouse_right`; `swipe_left`, `swipe_right`, `swipe_up`, `swipe_down`.

```ts
catwm.bind(["alt"], "mouse_down", ["workspace", "e+1"])
catwm.bind(["alt", "ctrl"], "swipe_left", ["workspace", "+1"])
```

- Matched scrolls are consumed; unmatched ones reach the app. Direction follows natural-scrolling.
- Trackpad scroll fires once per short burst; momentum after lift-off is ignored.
- Swipes can't be intercepted: macOS's own gesture still fires. Disable it in System Settings → Trackpad → More Gestures, or use another finger count. The "Swipe between pages / full-screen apps" gestures must be enabled for swipes to be reported.

## Defaults

The stock config (`mod` = Option) has these binds. Read the user's `catwm.config.ts` before you think a bind exists. **Restore Defaults** (Settings → Shortcuts) resets the binds.

Global binds:

- `CTRL`+`1..0` and `CTRL`+`left|right`: show a workspace. Add `SHIFT` to move the focused window there.
- `$mod`+`O`: Overview (`sort`). `$mod`+`Tab` and `$mod SHIFT`+`Tab`: window switcher.
- `SUPER`+`Caps Lock`: window mode.
- `$mod CTRL`+`H|J|K|L`: focus a neighbour. Add `SHIFT` to move the window.
- `$mod CTRL`+`F`: `fullscreen`. `$mod CTRL`+`V`: `togglefloating`.

Window mode (Vim set):

- `H J K L` and arrows: focus. `SHIFT`: move. `1..0`: workspace. `SHIFT`+`1..0`: move to workspace.
- `W` / `B`: next or previous display. `SHIFT`: move the window there.
- `N` / `P` and `S` / `SHIFT S`: next or previous layout.
- `,` / `.`: main pane size. `SHIFT`: main count. `M`: swap with main. `SHIFT M`: swap sides. `G`: focus main.
- `Tab` / `SHIFT Tab`: next or previous window. `CTRL`+`H|J|K|L`: into a tab group. `T`: out of the group. `[` / `]`: tabs.
- `F`: `fullscreen`. `SHIFT F`: macOS full screen. `V`: float. `X`: close. `-`: minimise.
- `O`: Overview. `/`: window switcher. `` ` ``: previous workspace.
- `D`: dim other windows. `SHIFT D`: blur other windows.
- `Z`: retile. `SHIFT T`: pause tiling. `SHIFT R`: reload. `Esc`, `I`, `Return`: leave the mode.

The WASD set uses `W A S D` for focus, `Q E` for workspaces, `R` for layouts, `C` to float and `G` to swap with main. It has `O`, `/`, `` ` ``, `X` and `-` too, but no keys for dim, blur, focus main and the `S` layout keys.
