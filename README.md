## How to use CatWM

The central concept of CatWM is "Window mode", think of it as Vim's visual mode, the build mode in a game, or the tool keys in a drawing app. You enter it with `⌘ + tab`. This is where you can move windows, displays, change layouts and more.

Here is a overview of what key binds are available within window mode. (This is openable by pressing `?` within window mode)

### Workspaces

Unlike all the other macOS tilers I've ever seen, CatWM uses native spaces. This works well because CatWM uses SkyLight, the private macOS interface that Mission Control uses. It lets CatWM create and switch Desktops and move windows between them.

### Layouts

Every workspace has its own layout. Press `p` or `n` in window mode to cycle through them: tall, wide, columns, two pane, binary space partitioning, floating and more.

### Save workspaces

Quickly save and open workspaces, including some of the apps state.

<sub>We are currently working on adding adapters to save more app states, in this example you can see that we restore the active tab in helium. And that is the limit with chromium browsers for now.</sub>

### Overview

Reorder your windows without dealing with the native macOS fuss.

### Callable via cli

Agents (and humans) can call CatWM via cli. Every bind is a dispatcher, and the cli runs the same ones. Python, TypeScript and Swift libraries (see [Clients](Clients/README.md)) use the same commands and can listen for events.

```sh
catwm workspace 2
catwm movefocus left
catwm windows
catwm events focus.changed
```
