# Config: `~/.config/catwm/catwm.config.ts`

The config is plain TypeScript: one default-exported object. CatWM writes `catwm.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json` next to it, so an editor completes and checks every option, key and action.

```ts
import type { Bind, Config } from "./catwm"

const mod = "alt"

export default {
  mod,
  layouts: ["tall", "bsp", "fullscreen"],
  gaps: { size: 10 },
  padding: 10,
  animation: { curve: "spring", bounce: 0.6 },
  floating: { apps: ["com.apple.systempreferences", "com.apple.calculator"] },
  binds: [
    ...(["1", "2", "3"] as const).map((key): Bind => ({ mods: [mod], key, run: ["workspace", key] })),
    { mods: [mod], key: "return", run: ["exec", "open -na Terminal"] },
  ],
} satisfies Config
```

- **Save to apply.** CatWM watches the config folder and the folders of imported files. A save re-runs only the changed module and the modules that import it, then applies only the fields that changed. `catwm reload` runs every module again.
- **A broken save keeps the last good config.** The error goes to the log (`config: kept the last good config, …`), to the menu bar menu and to the `errors` of the `config.reloaded` event: `{ file, line, phase, message }`. The next good save clears it.
- **Data only.** Functions, loops and imports can compute the config, but the exported value must be plain data. A function in it is an error. There are no timers, events or native APIs. Use only erasable TypeScript syntax (no `enum` or `namespace`); the shipped `tsconfig.json` sets `erasableSyntaxOnly`.
- **Imports:** relative paths only, such as `import { binds } from "./binds"`. A type import from `"./catwm"` is free.
- **Settings and `catwm config.set`** never edit the TypeScript file. They write `catwm.overrides.json` beside it. The order is defaults, then `catwm.config.ts`, then the overrides. Settings → General lists each override and can drop it, so the file value applies again.
- **Features:** `features: { windows, input, services, presentation }` turns parts of CatWM on or off, such as `features: { presentation: { hud: true } }`. Every feature is on by default. Embedded mode will use these.
- **From `catwm.conf`:** the first launch converts an existing `catwm.conf` to `catwm.config.ts` once, checks that the result gives the same config, and keeps `catwm.conf` as an unread backup. If the conversion fails, CatWM keeps using `catwm.conf` and says why in the log and the menu bar menu.

## Options

Each option is a path in the config object: `gaps.size` is `gaps: { size: … }`. `padding` also takes one number for all four sides.

## Layout names

`tall`, `tall-right`, `wide`, `middle-wide`, `fullscreen`, `column`, `row`, `floating`, `bsp`, `3column-left`, `3column-middle`, `3column-right`, `two-pane`, `two-pane-right`, `widescreen-tall`, `widescreen-tall-right`.

## Settings window and saved configs

Menu bar → **Settings…** (⌘,). Panes: General, Layout, Windows, Motion, Templates, Shortcuts. Changes save to `catwm.overrides.json` and apply at once. **Configs** (menu bar submenu / Settings) stores named keyboard, animation, and full presets in `~/.config/catwm/configs.json`; switching one writes its values as overrides. Presets can be imported and exported.

Hand edits to `catwm.config.ts` apply on save. A value that Settings changed stays overridden until you drop it in Settings → General.

## Workspace templates

Settings → **Templates** lists saved workspaces with large screenshot previews. Click a screenshot to enlarge it. Open, rename, update, or delete a template here. A template stores app identities, document addresses when available, window frames, display sizes, layouts, main-pane ratios and counts, window order, tiling status, and floating, minimized, zoomed, or native full screen states. Templates are stored in `~/.config/catwm/templates.json`, separately from configs. Screenshots are stored in that file. Screen recording access is required to capture them. Saving still works without that access. Update an older template to add a screenshot.

With `template-app-scripting = true` (Settings → Templates → **Save tabs and folders**), a template also saves:

- the tabs of Safari and Chromium browser windows (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Helium), but not private or incognito windows
- the folders of Terminal and iTerm2 tabs
- the folders of each Finder window and its tabs
- the project of VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed and Xcode windows

macOS asks once for each scripted app to let CatWM control it. The code editors need no permission: CatWM reads their recent-project files. A background tab of a Terminal or Finder window is saved as a tab of its window, not as a separate window.

Opening the template reopens the browser tabs, the iTerm2 tabs and all Terminal tabs (through a temporary Terminal window group). It opens each Finder window at its selected folder, and each editor at its project, so that the editor brings back its own files and panes. If an app does not allow control, CatWM opens the window as before.

Each saved window in `templates.json` can have an optional `launch` object that you edit by hand: `"url"` opens a URL or deep link with the app (for example `vscode://file/…` or `slack://channel?…`), `"arguments"` passes launch arguments when CatWM starts the app, and `"command"` runs a shell command with `sh -c` instead of opening a new window. `command` is used first, then saved tabs, then `url`, then the saved document.

In window mode, tap the mode modifier to open quick actions at the pointer. Press **S** to show a name field beside Save. Type the name and press Return to save without opening Settings. The screenshot can finish after the template saves. Escape cancels naming and returns to the action list. Press **1–9** to open a saved template. Hover a template to replace its number with an X. Click the X to delete it without closing the menu. Arrow keys and Return select an action. These actions also work over empty desktop space.

Quick actions also retain the focus controls: **D** toggles Dim other windows, and **B** toggles Blur other windows.

Restore reuses matching windows in the current workspace, opens missing apps or supplied documents, and requests new windows from apps that support them. Missing displays use available displays. Frames scale to fit. Existing extra windows stay open. Tabs, unsaved work, and other internal app state are not saved. CatWM reports windows that it cannot open or position.
